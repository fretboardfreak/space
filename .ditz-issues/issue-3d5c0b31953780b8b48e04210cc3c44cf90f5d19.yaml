title: Implement Asynchronous Events
desc: When something happens that results in a timed event of some sort an event object can be registered to an Event thread.  Then when the event is triggered something in the game model can be updated.  For instance, this will make it possible to have building construction take some amount of time before the building is ready.  Multiple event objects can be registered by a user action in order to achieve the desired effect; also, events could potentially have more than one atomic side effect.
