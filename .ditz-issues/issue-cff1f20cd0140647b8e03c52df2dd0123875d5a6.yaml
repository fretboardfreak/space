title: "Resources: add logic for absolute_value vs. trade_value representation"
desc: A planet cannot have a negative amount of a tangible resource like Ore. The resources object currently enforces this.  However, for some calculations and to represent the cost of constructing a building there should be a flag to switch the Resources logic into a mode where negative values can be sensibly used.
